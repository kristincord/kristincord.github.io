			Why should those of us that sleep past ten not get a croissant that is a perfect ten. We are not birds, we do not eat worms, so why does the early bird still get the worm? Late Risers is Dedicated to Those Who Sleep. Why do barkeeps need to stay up so late? They like to sleep too. Why should bars be open so late? Early Drinkers deserve to have dinner at home. We are Late Risers and Early Drinkers. We are making the 9-5 cool again.
